# 🚀 Deployment Guide - GitHub Pages

This guide explains how to deploy your Legal AI Simplifier to GitHub Pages for live demonstration.

## 🌐 Automatic Deployment

The project is configured for **automatic deployment** to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the `main` branch.

### Live URL
**https://harshad2321.github.io/Legal-AI-Simplifier**

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
Located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, this workflow:
- Triggers on every push to `main` branch
- Installs Node.js dependencies
- Builds the React application
- Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically

### 2. Package.json Configuration
```json
{
  "homepage": "https://harshad2321.github.io/Legal-AI-Simplifier",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Initial Setup (One-time)
- ✅ GitHub repository created
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ✅ Package.json homepage field set
- ✅ gh-pages package installed

### For Each Deployment
- ✅ Code committed to main branch
- ✅ Push to GitHub repository
- ✅ GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys
- ✅ Site available at live URL within 2-3 minutes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
If deployment fails:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs in repository
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
3. Verify TypeScript compilation errors are fixed
4. Check that build command works locally

### Live Site Issues
- **404 Errors**: Ensure homepage field matches your repository name
- **Blank Page**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Missing Assets**: Verify all files are included in build directory

## 🌟 Features on Live Site

### What Works
- ✅ Premium UI components and animations
- ✅ Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- ✅ Interactive dashboard with mock data
- ✅ Clause explorer with expandable sections
- ✅ Q&A chat interface with simulated responses
- ✅ Report download page with customization options
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile devices

### Backend Integration
- ⚠️ Backend APIs are not available on GitHub Pages (static hosting)
- Mock data and simulated responses are used for demonstration
- For full functionality, backend would need separate hosting (Google Cloud Run, Railway, etc.)

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

The live site is fully responsive and optimized for:
- **Desktop** - Full feature set with hover effects
- **Tablet** - Adapted layouts with touch-friendly interactions
- **Mobile** - Optimized navigation and compact components

## 🎯 Demo Strategy
